icyhttpd by [Gong Lu(龚路)](http://www.iceboy.org/) leverages the use of both I/O multiplexing and fibers to build a user-level threading framework with high scalability. It enables programmer to write threaded code in a
heavily concurrent environment without losing performance. Our framework achieves a M:N threading model, which hosts M userlevel threads on top of N kernel-level threads. To demonstrate the usefulness of this framework, we provide a proof-of-concept [open source](https://code.google.com/p/icyhttpd/) implementation of a web server application.
